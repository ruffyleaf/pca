Principal Component Analysis of uscrime.csv
========================================================

Data Exploration and Data Preparation
-----
```{r}
#Read in the data into a dataframe
uscrime <- read.csv("uscrime.csv")

#Display the first few entries
head(uscrime)

#Display the structure of the data
str(uscrime)

#Summary of the data
summary(uscrime)

#Check for missing values
sum(complete.cases(uscrime))

#Keep the complete cases only
uscrime <- uscrime[complete.cases(uscrime),]

```

Preparing for factorization
---------
1. We prepare the variables for factorization
2. Analyse the factorability using Correlation, significance and also the sampling adequacy

```{r}
# We want to factorize only the variables that make some sense
uscrimepc <- uscrime[,c(4:10)]

library(Hmisc)

#Analyse the Variables Correlation and Significance
rcorr(as.matrix(uscrimepc))

#Check the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin factor adequacy
#Values above 0.5 are considered adequate.
library(psych)
KMO(uscrimepc)

#Using Bartlett's test to check if the Correlation Matrix is an Identity matrix.
#If the p-value is low, then we can reject the null hypothesis that the Correlation Matrix is an Identity matrix.
cortest.bartlett(uscrimepc)
```
